### How to build the application on server
- This is a springboot application which internally uses Jersey Jax-RS features.
- Make sure the build system (your device) is installed with java 8+ version. Please check this by typing (java -version) on the CLI.
- Make sure the build system (your device) is installed with gradle version 7.2. Please check this by typing (gradle -v) on the CLI.
- Checkout the project into a directory. Go to inside the analytics directory and run "gradle build".
- This command will take few seconds to compile the code. After successful compilation, a jar file (./build/libs/analytics-0.0.1.jar)
will be generated. That jar file includes all the dependencies to run the program.
